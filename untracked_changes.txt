This is a list of everything that I have changed about this system that I can't track with dotfiles.

1. I have installed a macOS cursor theme.
2. I have installed a WhiteSur gtk3 theme.
  - I replaced the Adwaita files with the WhiteSur theme to change nautilus colors
  - This should be unnecessary in the future - just use dconf to change the theme
3. I made a special script to allow nautilus to open text files with alacritty nvim
  - (Script in /scripts)
4. I installed a nautilus extension that allows me to open alacritty in current directory
5. I wrote a brightness control python script to scale exponentially / transition smoothly
  - (Script in /scripts)
6. I installed grimblast to local bin
7. I wrote a small script for cleaning up orphaned packages
  - (Script in /scripts)
8. I installed a macOS SF Mono Nerd Font
9. I replaced the loupe bin with a script to launch it with the correct theme
10. I wrote a script for moving files to the trash instead of rm -rf
